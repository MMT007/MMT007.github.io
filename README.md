# About Me
I'm Fabiano Madeira Ribeiro, live in Brazil and I'm currently 17 y.o.

I love playing games and Minecraft is my favorite. ( I also love modding it too )

## Skills
== Programming (Java) - Music == 

## Exprerience
Most of my experience comes from modding Minecraft, making me quite familiar on how Java is structured and it's inner workings.
One of my most recent mods is called [Musicalia](), and it helped me learn about Networking and Protocols.

I've also programmed a game in Godot called [The Memory Maze](https://mmt007.itch.io/the-memory-maze), it is in development, but it has already taught me a lot about Game Development, Game Design and Networking.

Another one of my passions is music! Most of wich is posted on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/@mmt007_backup) and [Newgrounds](https://mmt007backup.newgrounds.com/).
Beign part of the school band only taught me the basics on how music is composed, and I still have much to learn.

## Education
I'm still completing highschool.
I also have a [certificate] on Java Basics from the Brazil's Federal Institution located in RS (Rio Grande Do Sul).
